## But why..? ðŸ‘€

This was created as the standard [template](https://github.com/get-convex/turbo-expo-nextjs-clerk-convex-monorepo) that Convex provides is a bit outdated.
This monorepo also includes the following:

- Shared tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Typescript)
- Package.json based workspaces
- Organized exports (don't export the whole module!)
- Shared scripts folder
- Updated packages (Latest ESLint, Prettier, Next, etc.)
- AGENTS.md files for agentic AI workflows (Cursor, Opencode, etc.)
- Github CI workflows that use Turborepo

## Getting Started

To setup convex backend please run::

```sh
bun run --filter @acme/backend init
```

Finally, make sure to run the following script for your own namespace:

```sh
bun scripts/replace.ts
```
